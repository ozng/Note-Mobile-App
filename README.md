## Setting up the development environment

---

Assuming that you have Node 14 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then run the following commands to install dependencies:

```
npm install

npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

This will start a development server for you.
